# Engineering Computations

> A collection of learning modules on computing for engineering and science students

**Project lead: Prof. Lorena A. Barba**

Professor Barba developed a two-course series in engineering computations at the George Washington University (courses MAE-1117 and MAE-2117).
The materials for those courses are written in a modular fashion, and consist of five self-contained modules that can be individually adopted by other instructors.
